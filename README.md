# StoreAndRetrieveTxtFiles

This C++ program defines a Student class with attributes name, roll, and branch, along with overloaded stream insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators for file I/O operations. It creates a Student object, writes its data to a file named "Student.txt", and then reads the data back from the file, displaying the student's name, roll, and branch on the console.
